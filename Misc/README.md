# Miscellaneous 

This directory contains code to perform miscellaneous tasks mostly 
related to better understanding the performance of HybridLinker, 
but also better understanding the annotated networks. 

Most of this code was written to be "one time use" and is therefore less consistent 
in its documentation, convention, and type declaration than other 
software in this repository. Future versions *may* remedy this.

As always, email the developer at `rubelato@reed.edu` if you have questions.
